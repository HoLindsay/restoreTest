Since 2016, when drone become a trend for filming, aerial mapping and others, then Restore WTC decided to have a team that cooperate together to explore and study about drone. Interest and passion to the studies in our scope are one of our priority to achieve our vision and mission. Our goals are discovering all kinds of drone invented, researching their features and capabilities and spread out to the world about our findings in drone technology.

However, we also require full cooperation from the drone inventors to receive their statement and specifications about their drone before we jump to the conclusions. Hope our goals can be achieved until there are more advance than drone invented in the future. Feedback and share that show you care. Cheerio!
