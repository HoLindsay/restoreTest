Drones that follow you came on the picture found in 2016 and the follow me innovation features continued ever since. Various drones with follow me GPS mode, likewise have many other intelligent flight devices (Orbit, ActiveTrack, Points of Interest, Waypoints, Circle, Terrain Abide by etc) giving you even more flying and filming choices.

Having a drone that comes after you has many benefits including capturing superb moving selfies with your loved kinds and capturing your adventures in very scenic locations.

We are also finding many sportsmen, cyclists and mountaineers use follow me Gps navigation drones to film from various angles with the best goal of improving their technique.

Flying applying the drone in Follow Me mode is also terrific fun.Comply with me mode is fairly amazing technology.

Most of the drones featured here are appearing used professionally because they have exceptional cameras and stabilization. You can read even more on the countless uses for drones below. This article also excellent videos.

Having a drone that comes after you along with having a 4k camera, you then know you will get the very best film and continue to photos of your adventures. To go with this document, also examine in on our content of the greatest 4k drones out there.

## Follow Me GPS navigation Drone Technology

Follow Me can be an intelligent struggle mode which turns your drone right into a hands-free of charge aerial surveillance camera crew. We are now finding 2 types of Follow Me technology in use. There may be the GSC with Stick to Me GPS navigation transmitter technology and the latest using recognition program such as DJI ActiveTrack.

### Drone That Follow You Working with GPS Transmitter/ GSC 

Various follow me mode drones use a GPS enabled device such as a cellular phone, tablet or a Surface Station Controller (GSC) along with a transmitter (wearable transmitter or mobile phone). The drone can be programmed to check out the transmitter and also to keep the subject matter in the picture all the time.

Follow me technology makes a virtual tether between the drone and a GPS-equipped mobile device, that allows the drone to monitor you or another subject matter in motion. Most Follow me UAVs, may also remain stationary and track the topic by rotating, or it can move together with the subject.

The AirDog featured even more down can be an example of this sort of drone follow technology.

### Drone That Follows You Using Recognition Technology

The most recent following drones, which use sensors and recognition technology along with software algorithms are the following:

 - DJI Mavic Air
 - DJI Spark
 - DJI Mavic Pro
 - DJI Phantom 4
 - DJI Inspire 2
 - Yuneec Typhoon H
 - Yuneec Breeze
 - Walkera Scout X4
 - Walkera Voyager 4
 - Walkera Voyager 5
 - Walkera Vitus
 - SpellPro Splash 3 Auto

Sensors and reputation technology, along with program algorithms give UAVs the opportunity to recognize and follow a good person or perhaps object. This deep learning pursuing drone technology permits the UAV to monitor a moving subject with out a separate GPS tracker.

You can see from the above list that DJI will be the leading manufacture of drones with follow you technology.

In DJI quadcopters, the program is named ActiveTrack and is made in to the DJI Pilot Go 4 App and Assistant software for the Phantom 4. The program allows you choose the object on screen, after that fly around it at least one time to ensure that the UAV learns to identify you.

## Drone Follow Me Software

The software to program Carry out Me is normally built into the overall drone application. DJI possess their Get 4 App. 3DR drones employ their SOLO App and the Arducopter d-i-y drone uses Objective Planner software.

Other manufacturers build the follow me mode software into the Ground Station Controller (GSC) such as Walkera. With several clicks you software what you want to check out or track.

The program is pretty advanced using algorithms and calculations to track and keep the object in view always. Most Follow Me applications allow you to plan the gimbal and surveillance camera with pre-set air travel distances, elevation and angles presenting your video very specific cinematic perspectives.

## Follow Me Distance

Each UAV supplier use distinct ranges with their follow me technology.  It really is probably greatest to keep carefully the distance short initially as you get to know your drone. If an excessive amount of distance is allowed between your GSC and the transmitter, both could lose their interconnection.

With DJI, drones including the Phantom 4, the GPS is very strong at a height of 30 meters (98.4 feet) and a distance of 20 meters (66.5 feet). DJI drones can abide by you at a much further distance than this.

The 3DR SOLO drone permits a distance between the Ground Station Controller and the portable device as high as 150 meters (492 feet). My guidance is to keep carefully the distance short in the beginning.

## Flight Safety

It is great to remember that the vast majority of Follow Me method drones do not have object avoidance. Stick to Me mode is great in wide open spaces or where there will do space in order that their is definitely no break in the GPS navigation signal.

Very best practice is to method your your way and be mindful or any obstacles that your drone may potentially crash into. You may also plan your drone to fly above obstacles.

Just about any drone today lets you set a home point or a go back to home function. It is always best practice to create your home point.

Remember to monitor your electric battery and warnings. Don't get so overly enthusiastic with follow me filming that you operate low on battery.

## Best Follow Me Drones

Almost all of these drones featured below have extra intelligent air travel modes such as Waypoints, Orbit, SIGHTS which give you much more great filming angles and opportunities.

Each of the drones below possess tremendous gimbal and surveillance camera stabilization systems for capturing awesome video recording and stills.

Theses drones are very easy to fly. Inside our article entitled how to fly a quadcopter, we have excellent videos which show you just how easy it really is to fly these latest drones.

__Mavic Pro Quadcopter__

The Mavic Pro drone has so many Follow Me autopilot modes. The Mavic is nearly pocket sized, has a 4k surveillance camera and a 4.3 mile transmission range. It possesses 4 vision sensors, huge precision satellite navigation and most current flight controls devices giving it the very best autopilot systems to day.

## Collision Avoidance

Having great adhere to me modes is certainly terrific. However, without collision avoidance you need to be constantly aware of what your location is flying and filming. Usually you can crash quickly.

Nowadays the Mavic Pro has 4 vision sensors showing its flight control program what's below and in front. These vision sensors likewise work indoors presenting it the smoothest flying and hovering of any drone to time. Here is a number of the autopilot systems.

## ActiveTrack Follow Me

ActiveTrack is the intelligent technology gives you the various autopilot modes to check out, monitor and film with. The Mavic Pro gets the following autopilot modes:

-	Spotlight - circle, stick to behind or in the front on an subject matter while stationary or going.
-	Account - fly alongside the topic
