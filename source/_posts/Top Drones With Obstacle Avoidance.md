Lets start with probably the most popular and recent drones with collision avoidance program available today.

NOTE: If you buy any drone with obstacle detection and collision avoidance, please read the manual seeing that obstacle avoidance could be switched off using modes or won't work if circumstances such as lighting or surroundings are not suited to this obstacle avoidance sensor.

<!-- more -->

Here are 2 examples where obstacle avoidance technology may not work.  In bad lighting, obstacle avoidance may not work or certainly not work correctly.  Certain intelligent modes such as Sports method on the Mavic, obstacle sensing is switched off.

## DJI Mavic Air flow Obstacle Avoidance Drone

The brand new Mavic Air only released in January 2018 can sense objects in 3 directions. However, its forwards and backward vision system is much smarter than other drones.  Most of the drones is only going to hover when it senses and object in the front.  The Mavic Oxygen has the capacity to recalculate and also fly around the obstacle. It'll simply hover if ii cannot remap a way around the obstacle.

The DJI Mavic Air has Forwards, Backward and Downward vision system which is continually scanning for obstacles in the front, behind and below.  The Forward and Backward perspective system permits the Mavic Air in order to avoid collisions by flying either flying around the obstacle or hovering in the front.

FlightAutonomy 2.0 may be the brand for the DJI integrated system of sensors, algorithms and advanced VIO technology for the Mavic Oxygen.  This FlightAutonomy permits the Mavic Oxygen to sense it's environment and take action based on what is senses.

In general terms, VIO or Visual Inertial Odometry technology fuses information from the camera and inertial sensors, specifically IMU, gyroscopes and accelerometers, to accurately estimate unit position without counting on Satellite Navigation systems.

### Mavic Weather Obstacle Avoidance Sensors

The DJI Mavic Air uses advanced VIO technology in its powerful sensor system FlightAutonomy 2.0.  This involves a primary gimbal camera, ahead, backward, downward dual vision sensors, downward infrared sensing system, IMU redundancies and several computing core processors.

Together, these sensors acquire information from the encompassing environment and transmit it to the powerful processor for more exact hovering and better air travel performance.

The Downward Vision System helps the Mavic Air to keep its current location. It could hover set up very specifically.  The Mavic Oxygen Downward Vision System as well permits the quadcopter to fly indoors or different environments where their is no GPS signal.

The main hardware parts of the Downward Vision Program are 2 cameras in addition to a 3D Infrared module.

### Mavic Air APAS System

The Mavic Air comes with an Advanced Pilot Assistance Program (APAS) technology which is completely new.  The Mavic Oxygen APAS system allows the quadcopter to try and bypass obstacles in front of it, when you are flying using the Remote control Controller.

In other words, while you are flying forward, the Mavic Air is continually scanning it's surroundings for potential obstacles.  If the Mavic Weather detects an object or obstacle, it will calculate a safe way around the obstacle without stopping.  That is completely new technology which isn't on DJI different drones, the Mavic Pro or Spark.

If it is struggling to calculate or discover a safe path, it'll stop and hover set up.

### DJI Mavic Pro Obstacle Avoidance Drone

Types of obstacle recognition sensors used:

 - Vision Sensors
 - Ultrasonic Sensors

This high tech simple to fly Mavic drone has obstacle recognition and collision in 2 directions.  It fuses these sensors, its key camera and complex algorithms into its system named FlightAutonomy for obstacle recognition and avoidance.

FlightAutonomy comprises of 7 elements including 5 cameras (forwards and downward dual perspective sensors and the main camera), dual-band satellite positioning (GPS and GLONASS), 2 ultrasonic range-finders, redundant sensors, and several 24 powerful, specialized processing cores.

As the Mavic flies, dual forward and downward vision sensors gauge the distance between itself and obstacles by taking photos from all four cameras and using the info to produce a 3D map that tells it exactly where obstacles are.

The Mavic's Terrain Follow function uses height information gathered by the onboard ultrasonic system, and its own downward facing cameras to keep you flying at the same height above the bottom even as the bottom moves.

Both the ultrasonic sensors and vision sensors must fly indoors or without have GPS signals. The ultrasonic and vision sensors are also used for super easy hovering and landing.

## DJI Phantom 4 Pro Obstacle Avoidance Drone

The Phantom 4 Pro is a really outstanding drone.  It includes a terrific 4k surveillance camera and flies super stable. In fact, I viewed a training video recently where among its propellers was take off and it still flew very secure.   The Phantom 4 Pro also offers many auto intelligent airline flight modes as follows which will make filming real easy:

 - Active Track (Account, Spotlight, Circle)
 - Waypoints
 - apFly
 - Terrain Follow Mode
 - Tripod Mode
 - Gesture Mode
 - S-Mode (Sport)
 - P-Mode (Position)
 - A-Mode (Attitude)
 - Beginner Mode
 - Course Lock
 - Home Lock
 - Obstacle Avoidance

### Phantom 4 Pro Collision Avoidance

The Phantom 4 Pro has 5 guidelines of obstacle sensing and 4 guidelines of obstacle avoidance using the following types of sensors:

 - Stereo Vision
 - Infrared System

DJI fuse the previously mentioned sensors in a system that they call FlightAutonomy.

FlightAutonomy uses high-resolution stereo system vision sensors positioned at the rear and a pair placed at the front end together with infrared sensing systems placed on the still left and best sides. The Phantom 4 Pro uses a 6 camera navigation program.

Three sets of dual vision sensors form a 6 camera routing system which work constantly to calculate the relative rate and distance between your Phantom 4 and an object.

Using this networking of forward, rear and downward perspective sensors, the Phantom 4 Pro has the ability to hover specifically in place without GPS when removing indoors, on balconies or even when flying through house windows with reduced pilot control.

The Phantom 4 Pro has the capacity to fly in complex environments at a flight speed as high as 31 mph (50 km/h) while avoiding obstacles in its path. In Narrow Sensing Mode, the Phantom 4 Pro narrows its sensing scope allowing it to check out in greater detail and fly through little spaces.

## Perspective Sensors For Intelligent Trip Modes

Again, DJI utilize the Phantom 4 perspective sensors for more than just collision avoidance.  The sensors are being used to check out and track items and people within their autonomous flight modes.

The Phantom 4 is a huge choice for most professionals and can be utilised for a wide variety of uses such as inspections, 3D imaging and professional film making and photography.  Additionally it is very competitively priced.  Additionally, there are various Phantom 4 Pro bundle offers available.

## Walkera Vitus Collision Avoidance Drone

The brand new Walkera Vitus fold up drone flies super stable and takes terrific 4k high definition video and 12 megapixel stills.  It's simple to carry and incredibly simple to fly. Walkera constantly pack loads of technology into their drones.

### Walkera Vitus Collision Avoidance System

The Vitus has 3 guidelines of obstacle avoidance and in addition sensors for precision hovering. The sensors it uses happen to be as follows:

#### Time of Flight Sensor
 - Infrared Sensor
 - 3 high accuracy ToF sensors allow the Vitus to identify obstacles 16 feet (5 meters) away in 3 directions (front, left, right).

The Infrared sensor and also an optical flow camera on underneath of the Vitus takes images at 50 fps for positioning and precision hovering. This infrared sensor produces flying indoors possible without satellite signal.

## Walkera Voyager 5 Collision Avoidance Drone

The Voyager 5 may be the most up-to-date professional and commercial drone from Walkera that was only released in early 2018. What I really like about Walkera is normally that they seriously put as much technology to their drones as possible.

The Voyager 5 quadcopter integrates many flight safety systems including dual IMU, dual compass, and dual Global positioning system, to make it a lot more reliable and safer.

The Voyager 5 has a newly designed 3 axis brushless gimbal to permit a far more stabilized footage. It uses an advanced shock absorption gimbal technology which greatly reducing vibration and movement during trip, enabling the camcorder to fully capture stabilized and fluid footage also after magnifying the focal size.

There are 3 camera options for the Voyager 5 as follows:

 - 30x Optical Contact lens
 - Thermal Infrared camera
 - Low light night eyesight camera

### Voyager 5 Collision Avoidance Technology

The Voyager 5 has front and downward collision avoidance technology.

The front facing infrared obstacle avoidance module, altimeter and optical flow positioning module, allow the Voyager 5 to raised position and sense obstacles while flying, greatly reducing risks caused of crashes.

The Voyager 5 can find obstacles up to 16 feet (5 meters) in front with a 30 horizontal and 0 vertical field of view.

The downward vision sensor on the subject of the Voyager 5 works from an altitude of less than 10 feet (3 meters). Areas should have wealthy patterns and the light should be sufficient.

## Kespry 2.0 Collision Avoidance Drone

The Kespry company provide commercial aerial solutions such as for example inspections and surveying across many sectors including Mining, Telecom, Construction, Insurance and Roofing.

Their solution includes the Kespry 2.0 drone, the program for mapping and converting photos into understandable info for their clients. They also store the info in the cloud for their clients.

Kespry use high resolution cameras including the Sony UMC-R10C which has a big Exmor APS-C Sensor to fully capture 20 megapixels of colour at length to accurately calculate volumes, precisely measure distance and angles, and safely identify hazards or damage.

Kespry configures each surveillance camera to increase image quality for certain job types. The geo-tagged high-resolution photos are processed using photogrammetry in the Kespry cloud.

A single orthomosaic impression is then created to deliver top quality topographic maps, dimensional and volumetric info, and rich organization insights.

The Kespry 2.0  drone calculates the flight path and flies autonomously, applying LiDAR sensors to avoid obstacles.  Kespry don't go into any real details about the Lidar sensors that they are using. General, if you desire a full solution industrial drone, the Kespry 2.0 will probably be worth looking at.

## DJI Spark Drone With Collision Avoidance

The DJI Spark is a mini drone which features intelligent flight control options, a 2-axis mechanical stabilized gimbal, and a camera with incredible image quality. It launches from your hand and hovers in place within minutes. It uses face reputation to continue to keep you in focus.

It requires amazing aerial photos using just palm gestures, without the need for a remote controller or mobile machine.

The Spark's camera features a 1/2.3 inch CMOS sensor, letting you shoot stabilized video at 1080p and 12 megapixel stills. Much larger pixels mean Spark is definitely acutely sensitive to light and records colours precisely.

It has many intelligent air travel modes which you see about the Mavic such as for example TapFly, Sport, Gesture and in addition Quickshot.

### Spark Obstacle Sensing

The DJI Spark can sense objects and steer clear of obstacles in front of it and it can do that in Return-To-House mode also.

The Spark has a 3D Eyesight Sensing Program and uses the next sensors:

 - 3D Infrared Sensor Module - Front
 - 3D Infrared Sensor Module - Underside
 - 2D Camera - Underside

The Spark Vision Program uses 3D infrared and image data to greatly help the aircraft maintain it current position enabling precision hovering including indoors with GPS signal.

The 3D Eyesight system constantly scans for obstacles and feeds these details back again to the flight controller.  The Spark comes with an obstacle avoidance selection of 16 feet maximum.

## Yuneec Typhoon H / H Plus Collision Avoidance Drone

This Yuneec Typhoon H and the latest Typhoon H Plus drone uses the Intel RealSense technology to find and navigate around obstacles. It uses the  Intel RealSense R200 surveillance camera with an Intel atom driven module to build a 3D style of the world to stop the Typhoon H flying into obstacles. It  uses the next sensors:

 - Infrared laser camera sensor
 - Sonar Sensor

This RealSense technology is capable of remembering its environment, further boosting preventing possible collisions. The Typhoon H collision avoidance program is not reactionary.  If it avoids an obstacle once, it will remember the positioning of the obstacle and can automatically know in order to avoid it next time.

The Intel RealSense IR laser camera emits IR light into the scene of where it is going to fly. Based on the displacement of the design because of objects in the picture, it can calculate the length of the objects from the camera. This technique to calculate depth generally is called structured light, and this may be the way other 3D cameras, just like the original Kinect work.

The intelligent front sonar sensors allow the Typhoon H to stop short of obstacles automatically, ensuring a safer, stress-free flying experience. For instance, if the obstacle was too big just like a cliff and it can't prevent it, then your sonar sensors will minimize the Typhoon H before the cliff.

## Obstacle Avoidance Found in Follow Me Mode

In Follow Me mode, RealSense films everywhere to make sure collisions with objects are avoided. The Intel RealSense R200 surveillance camera with Intel Atom driven module builds a 3D model of the world, allowing you to concentrate on the topic without fretting about flying into obstacles.

## DJI Matrice 200 Collision Avoidance Drone

The DJI Matrice 200 is the most current commercial drone from DJI and has various uses including inspections of power series, bridge, cellphone towers etc. It is extremely adaptable and can take the Zenmuse X4S, X5S, Z30 and XT cams.

Additionally, it may carry a camera on top of the quadcopter and 2 cameras beneath the Matrice 200. So you possess a Zenmuse Z30 zoom surveillance camera and a thermal perspective camera mounted beneath the drone.

The Matrice 200 has various dual systems for fail safe redundancy such as for example dual battery, satellite navigation, IMU and IP43 protection. It also has many intelligent trip modes such as Sights and ActiveTrack.

### DJI M200 Obstacle Detection And Collision Avoidance

For obstacle recognition and collision avoidance, the DJI Matrice M200 combines various sensors the following:

 - Time of Flight laser Sensor
 - Stereo Vision Sensor
 - Ultrasonic Sensor

An upward facing Time-of-Flight laser sensor video camera recognizes objects previously mentioned.  The Matrice 200 uses Stereo Perspective sensors to find objects in front.  It also uses both Stereo Vision and Ultrasonic sensor below.

The Vision System contain 3 stereo vision sensors and 2 ultrasonic sensors on the front and bottom.

There are 2 Time of Flight infrared laser sensors along with the Matrice 200.

This whole Vision System constantly scans for obstacles allowing the Matrice 200  to go over, around or perhaps hover before the obstacle.
